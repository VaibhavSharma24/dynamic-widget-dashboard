## ðŸ”¥ Project Overview

This website is a Dashboard that provides security monitoring and visualization for cloud environments. It's designed to give security teams a comprehensive view of their cloud security posture across different security domains.

---

## ðŸ“Š Purpose and Features

The dashboard organizes security information into three main categories:

1. **CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)** â€” Shows cloud account status and risk assessments.
2. **CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform)** â€” Displays workload and namespace alerts.
3. **Registry Scan** â€” Presents container image security issues and vulnerabilities.

Each category contains widgets that visualize specific security metrics using charts and statistics. Examples include:

- **Cloud Accounts widget** â€” Shows connected vs. disconnected accounts.
- **Risk Assessment widget** â€” Displays passed, failed, and warning security checks.
- **Image Security widgets** â€” Show vulnerabilities by severity level.

Users can:
- Dynamically add new widgets (with a name and text).
- Remove widgets from a category.
- Search across all widgets.

## ðŸ§  State Management with Zustand

This application uses **Zustand**, a lightweight state management library.

```javascript
export const useWidgetStore = create<DashboardState>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // Store state and functions
    }),
    {
      name: "dashboard-storage",
    }
  )
)
```

### Key Aspects:

- **Local Storage Persistence**  
  The `persist` middleware saves dashboard state to the browser's local storage, preserving user changes across sessions.

- **Widget Management Functions**
  - `addWidgetToCategory`: Add a widget to a specific category.
  - `removeWidgetFromCategory`: Remove a widget from a category.
  - `createWidget`: Create a new custom widget.
  - `searchWidgets`: Search across all available widgets.
  - `getWidgetsByCategory`: Retrieve widgets for a specific category.

- **Initial Data**  
  The store is pre-populated with initial categories and widgets for a ready-to-use dashboard experience.

## ðŸŒŸ Conclusion

The combination of **Zustand** with local storage persistence offers a smooth, backend-free solution for managing user preferences and dashboard configurations dynamically.
